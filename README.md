Created by Gabrielle Umbach
____________
I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. It calls the GIPHY API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

### Why the Project is Useful ###
The app fulfilled a project assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. It provided me with the opportunity to work with the following technologies:
* Bootstrap
* JSON
* Ajax
* HTTP GET requests
* Server-side APIs
